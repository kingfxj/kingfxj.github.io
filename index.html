            <p>I started of by using Python to learn the basic of programming including data structures, recursion, modularizations and functional programming. Moving forward, I used C and C++ in Unix Environment focuses on fundamental principles of software engineering based on abstract data types and implementations. I also learned algorithm design and analysis, emphasizing on searching, sorting and graph algorithms. Regarding file and database management, I used SQL, relational query languages to learn computer data organization, information processing, entity-relationship model, and relational model. In advanced class, we also learned concurrent execution of transactions, indexing, advanced construct in SQL, and cloud-based database systems. In higher level courses, I learnt Software Process and Product Management (All phases of software are reviewed from a process perspective), Web Applications and Architecture (architecture of modern web-based information systems, web data exchange and serialization and service-oriented middleware), Foundation of Program Analysis (Intermediate representations, inter-procedural and intra-procedural analysis, call graphs, points analysis and analysis frameworks), Search, Knowledge and Simulation (Understand the short and long-term consequences of possible actions and state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms). I learned AI and Games programming (search and problem-solving techniques, knowledge representations, reasoning and acting under uncertainty and machine learning, solving deterministic shortest path, combinatorial optimization problems, constraint satisfaction and multi-agent problems). Last but not the least, I learned Advanced Games Programming, focusing on State-of-the AI, graphics for video games and openGL.</p>
            <p>Throughout university, I focused on learning skills and also apply them through projects. During both volunteer and projects experiences, I learned communication skills and how to work in a team. Throughout my first work job, it was really fast pace and I learned how to organize, distribute works to team members and focus on details. I believe all of these helps me for my future and I am always eager to improve and learn from the people around me. It is important to keep an positive attitude of myself and enjoy the time with the people around you.</p>
