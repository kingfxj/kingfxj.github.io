        <h1 class="nav" >About me</h1>
        <p>I started of by using Python to learn the basic of programming including data structures, recursion,
            modularization and functional programming. Moving forward, I used C and C++ in Unix Environment focuses on
            fundamental principles of software engineering based on abstract data types and implementations. I also
            learned algorithm design and analysis, emphasizing on searching, sorting and graph algorithms. Regarding
            file and database management, I used SQL, relational query languages to learn computer data organization,
            information processing, entity-relationship model, and relational model. In advanced class, we also learned
            concurrent execution of transactions, indexing, advanced construct in SQL, and cloud-based database systems.
            In higher level courses, I learnt Software Process and Product Management (All phases of software are
            reviewed from a process perspective), Web Applications and Architecture (architecture of modern web-based
            information systems, web data exchange and serialization and service-oriented middleware), Foundation of
            Program Analysis (Intermediate representations, inter-procedural and intra-procedural analysis, call graphs,
            points analysis and analysis frameworks), Search, Knowledge and Simulation (Understand the short and
            long-term consequences of possible actions and state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms). I learned AI
            and Games programming (search and problem-solving techniques, knowledge representations, reasoning and
            acting under uncertainty and machine learning, solving deterministic shortest path, combinatorial
            optimization problems, constraint satisfaction and multi-agent problems). Last but not the least, I learned
            Advanced Games Programming and focused on State-of-the AI, graphics for video games and openGL.</p>
        <p>Throughout university, I focused on learning skills and also apply them through projects. During both
            volunteer and projects experiences, I learned communication skills and how to work in a team. Throughout my
            first work job, it was really fast pace, and I learned how to organize, distribute works to team members and
            focus on details. I believe all of these helps me for my future, and I am always eager to improve and learn
            from the surrounding people. It is important to keep a positive attitude of myself and enjoy the time with
            the people around you.</p>
